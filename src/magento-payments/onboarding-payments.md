title: Onboarding Payments
---

Magento Payments is your turnkey self-service solution---including sandbox testing, fraud prevention, and a super simple setup---for implementing a robust payments services for your Magento store.

To get started using Magento Payments you must complete a few onboarding steps to connect your instance with our payments functionality---it's as easy as 1-2-3.

1. [Connect your Magento instance](#configure-magento-services) to Magento Software as a Service (SaaS) services. This only needs to be completed once per Magento instance.
1. [Enable Sandbox testing](#enable-sandbox-testing) (or, alternatively, [enable live payments](#enable-live-payments) if you've tested functionality in another environment) to set up a test PayPal payment processing account.
1. [Choose Magento Payments as your payment method](#set-magento-payments-as-payment-method) of choice.

If you have not yet configured your Magento Services in the Admin, you cannot proceed to setting up Sandbox or Live payments.

## Onboarding flow

## Prerequisites

In order to use Magento Payments, you must have the following extensions available for your instance:

* Services Connector module
* Services ID module
* API keys

These extensions will be automatically installed during the installation of the Magento Payments extension. Once installed, you will see a new section in the Admin---in **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Services**---called Magento Services.

### Find credentials

Consuming a Magento SaaS service from a Commerce instance starts with creating API keys in [My Account](https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login). A given API key pair is valid for all Magento SaaS services in a given environment, so if you already have [Magento Services]({% link system/saas.md %}) configured your API key pair is already present in the Admin.

Two different API key pairs can be created for a Magento account---one for Sandbox and one for Production (live payments)---though only one can be actively used at a time.

See the [Magento Services topic]({% link system/saas.md%}) to learn how to generate an API key for either Sandbox or Production environments.
